### Objective
Create a frontend Todo List application using React or Next.js with the following features:

### Requirements
Core Features:
* Create Task: Allow users to add new tasks.

* Update Task: Allow users to edit existing tasks.

* Mark as Done: Allow users to mark tasks as completed.

* Search Tasks: Implement a search functionality to filter tasks.

* Expandable List: Display tasks in an expandable list format, showing a description and a timestamp of the last update when expanded.

### Framework:
Used Next.js for the frontend.

Code Quality: Ensure the code is well-organized, modular, and properly commented.

### Additional Features:
* Server-Side Rendering (SSR): Implemented SSR for the application (only applicable if using Next.js).

* URL Parameters: Used URL parameters to handle search functionality.


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
